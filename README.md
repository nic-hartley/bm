# userscripts

A collection of bookmarklets.
Each has:

- Autoupdates, so you get the latest version every time you run it
- Its full source code right here in this repo
- No dependencies and simple, vanilla JS for rapid loading

## Installation

Each header is a link. If you right-click that link, you should see an option to bookmark it. You can then run the bookmarklet from your bookmarks bar, and it should apply to whatever page you're looking at.
